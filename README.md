# tocy

A tiny tool to produce Table Of Content (TOC) for README.md of Github.com.

## How to Use

There are 2 ways to incorporate TOC generated by tocy into README.md:

1. You can set a placeholder string **[tocy]** in your READMD.md, the
placeholder will be replaced by TOC by running the command below. 
The placeholder **must** be a seperated paragraph according to markdown rule.
2. No placeholder, just run the command below and do **copy&paste** the TOC
to the proper place in your REAMD.md.

### placeholder

`[tocy]` or `[TOCY]`

### command

``` shell
$ python3 tocy.py path/to/README.md
```

### caveat 

#### 1

I prefer to set placeholder at the top of README.md for simplicity, as this
file shows above. I deliberately use many title lines here for demostration.

#### 2

Everytime you change the title lines in README.md, your should issue the
command above again before commit! If more than one placeholder in your
README.md file, the first one is replaced!

#### 3

The placeholder string is case insensitive!

## Example

### placeholder

Placeholder in README.md:

```
...

[tocy]

...
```

### no placeholder

If no placeholder, the output is just like:

``` shell
$ python3 tocy.py README.md
* [tocy](#tocy)
    * [How to Use](#How-to-Use)
        * [placeholder](#placeholder)
        * [command](#command)
        * [caveat](#caveat)
            * [1](#1)
            * [2](#2)
            * [3](#3)
    * [Example](#Example)
        * [placeholder](#placeholder)
        * [no placeholder](#no-placeholder)
```

Have fun! ^___^
